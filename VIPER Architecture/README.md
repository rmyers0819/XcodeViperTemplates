To install the VIP Xcode templates:

1)Check out the 'master' branch from the xcode_templates directory 
2) Navigate in terminal in the XCode Templates directory:
3) Make sure you are in the same directory as the "makefile" file
4) Run:

> make install_templates

To uninstall the VIP Swift Xcode templates, run:

> make uninstall_templates

To update the VIP templates, simply run the install script again

> make install_templates


To edit the individual templates, edit them in the base folder. If any of the directory names are changed the Makefile script will need to be updated to reflect the change.
